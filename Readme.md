### Why Boost.Asio?
Writing networking code that is portable is easy to maintain has been an issue since long. 
C++ took a step to resolve this issue by introducing boost.asio. It is a cross-platform C++ 
library for network and low-level I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent 
asynchronous model using a modern C++ approach. 

Hereâ€™s a list of what it offers:

- Cross platform networking code (code would work on Windows, Linux, etc.)
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- Asynchronous event support
- Timer support
- iostream compatibility
- And much more. You can get the complete overview of the library here.
